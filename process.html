                              <p>I began working on research ever since I started an internship at a local bike company a few years ago, and then I started building this projeect during the Design Studio class last summer. I read through several articles online about the current cycling scene in the US, and talked with my friends who ride bikes about the barriers that stop women, LGBTQIA, and BIPOC folks from cycling. Based on my own experience, and according to that research and to other people's thoughts, Peachy Cycles was created. You can view the list of resources <a href="assets/bibliography.pdf" target="_blank"><span class="link">here.</span></a>
                              </p>

                              <p>Why the name 'Peachy Cycles'?
                                 <span class="text-highlight">Because all butts on bikes!</span> I wanted to bring a goofy fun approach to express positivity and a laid-back welcoming vibe.</p>

                                 <p>Then, to come up with the website sections or features, I did user some user-interviews and user-testing with a few people from my network and with folks from cycling groups in the country. I asked them what features they would like to see in Peachy Cycles, and <span class="text-highlight">what do current cycling websites lack? What would make biking more accessible?</span> 
                                 </p>

                                    <p>This platform provides riders with resources and knowdlege of bike safety, maintenance, fitting, routes and more. It is community-focused, where everyone gets involved to create workshops, host group ride events and offer their expertise in bike maintenance, and writing articles. Future goal is to bring this website to life, host live events, and continue to expand it across the US!  </p>
