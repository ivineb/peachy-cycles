                              <p>The bicycling industry in the US is known to be dominated by white men. Women, people of color, and the LGBTQIA+ community find biking an intimidating activity with an uninviting environment.  
                                 <br><br>
                                 The main reasons why they refrain from cycling are: feeling unsafe on the roads, lacking knowledge, skills and resources, and finally not being able to be a part of a community. Most cycling groups are competitive, and intimidating.
                              </p>

                              <h2><br>Project Goal</h2>
                              <!-- <p>
                                 Peachy Cycles aims to empower, educate and provide connection, support and resources to the underserved communities. This platform equips cyclists with tools and knowledge to make biking accessible. It also connects cyclists together and to bike shops to create events and build diverse cycling teams. The goal is to create a tight-knit cycling community where everyone feels welcomed and empowered.
                              </p> -->

                              <p class="about-me">I am a designer and illustrator currently based in the Twin Cities. With this MCAD program, I am shifting my undergrad degree from print to a more digital-focused career. I am interested in working on projects that solves societal and environmental issues. My passion for cycling started when I was little, riding my bike is like going to therapy-- I always come back a different person. When I'm not biking or designing, I can be found hiking, swimming, watching indie movies, and baking.
